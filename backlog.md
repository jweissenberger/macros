# Backlog

- check for C: in the output and give a warning that they'll have to update it with the path on their computer that they'll want
- turn all inputs to lowercase
- prompt is too big: 
    filter out stop words, have multiple prompt files and do searches for key words from the input text and try and match
    it with the best text document
    could eventually do sentence embeddings
